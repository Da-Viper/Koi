Koi - Theme scheduling for the KDE Plasma Desktop

This is a TODO list 

[x] add cursors style 
[ ] add window decoration // i am having a hard time figuring out how to get all the window decoration on the system 

// i found a way but not sure if it is optimal tho.

like moving some methods from the utils class into there if they are related as the utils class it too large for my liking.
[ ] clean up the cmakelists directory 
[ ] remove redundant code 
[ ] add ability to run scripts
