this is a document concerning the ui part of the settings dialog for future me

this is the structure of the settings page

the settings page will inherit

Settings
----General
--------notification
--------autostart
----Profiles
--------add/edit

--------edit
--------remove
----Other(this is for other stuff that is not related  to the general or profiles page )


NOTE: i am using pages structure,
    i.e each page has its own corresponding .ui/.cpp/.h file there will be no stacked/tab widget
    this way it is easier to maintain/change and correct errors that may occur if stacked/tab widget is used the file
    can get up to 1000 lines and become hard to maintain or find something. this way you can easily go to the
    corresponding page of the ui


Settings Page [settingdialog] ##KPageDialog
    This page will have no ui as it is just for connecting the general, profile and other page together.

General Page
    This page is for settings concering the application itself all settings come here .

    ---- notification
            for controlling if the app shows notification
    ---- autostart
            add the desktop file to the autostart folder
